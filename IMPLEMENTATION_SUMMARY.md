### Task 7: Exports & Schema Sanity
- ✅ Created JSON schemas for each mode (`schemas/exports/`)
- ✅ Implemented schema validator with detailed error reporting
- ✅ Created enhanced exporter with validation
- ✅ Added support for JSON, CSV, and XLSX formats

### Task 8: Tests & Diagnostics
- ✅ Created comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Added integration tests for end-to-end pipeline
- ✅ Implemented diagnostics exporter with error taxonomy
- ✅ Created test fixtures and reporting tools

### Task 9: Netlify Hardening
- ✅ Enhanced `netlify.toml` with security headers
- ✅ Added function timeout and memory configuration
- ✅ Implemented CORS and cache policies
- ✅ Created deployment verification script

```

### Netlify Configuration
- Node 18+ with esbuild bundling
- Function timeout: 30 seconds
- Security headers and CORS
- Cache policies for different content types

## 📊 Testing

### Test Suites
