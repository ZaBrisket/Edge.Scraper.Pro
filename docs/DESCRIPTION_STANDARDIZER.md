# Company Description Standardization Engine

## Overview

The Description Standardization Engine transforms verbose, marketing-heavy company descriptions into concise, factual summaries optimized for M&A target analysis.

## Features

- **Automatic Standardization**: Converts descriptions to â‰¤30 words
- **Industry Detection**: Identifies company sector from content
- **Smart Verb Selection**: Uses appropriate action verbs based on business type
- **Acronym Preservation**: Maintains industry-standard abbreviations
- **Marketing Removal**: Strips superlatives and vague claims
- **Fallback Logic**: Handles missing or incomplete data gracefully

## Configuration

The standardizer can be toggled on/off via the UI checkbox or by setting:

```javascript
CONFIG.ENABLE_DESCRIPTION_STANDARDIZATION = true/false
```

## Processing Rules

### Information Hierarchy
1. Core function (what the company does)
2. Key offerings/services (2-3 specific items)
3. Target market (if space permits)

### Verb Taxonomy
- **Service**: provides, delivers, offers
- **Manufacturing**: manufactures, produces, develops
- **Distribution**: distributes, sells, supplies
- **Consulting**: advises, consults, guides
- **Management**: manages, operates, oversees

### Quality Filters

**Removed**:
- Superlatives (leading, innovative, premier)
- Time-based claims (established 1990, 30 years experience)
- Geographic superlatives (nationwide, global)
- Revenue indicators
- Marketing language

**Preserved**:
- Industry acronyms (SaaS, API, CRM, HVAC)
- Specific service offerings
- Target market identifiers
- Technical specifications
