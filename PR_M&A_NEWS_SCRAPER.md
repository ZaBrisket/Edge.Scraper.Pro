## 🧪 Testing

### Test Coverage
- ✅ Deal value extraction accuracy
- ✅ Company name recognition
- ✅ Transaction type classification
- ✅ Date parsing and normalization
- ✅ URL discovery configuration
- ✅ RSS feed parsing
- ✅ Search API integration

### Test Results
```
Test 1: Deal Value Extraction
  ✅ $68.7 billion → {normalized: 68700000000, display: "$68.7 billion"}
  ✅ $3.5 million → {normalized: 3500000, display: "$3.5 million"}
  ✅ USD 500 million → {normalized: 500000000, display: "$500 million"}

Test 2: Company Extraction
  ✅ "Microsoft Corporation acquires Activision Blizzard Inc."
  ✅ Found: ["Microsoft Corporation", "Activision Blizzard Inc."]

Test 3: Transaction Type Detection
  ✅ "merges with" → merger
  ✅ "acquires" → acquisition
  ✅ "divests" → divestiture
  ✅ "joint venture" → joint_venture

Test 4: Date Extraction
  ✅ "January 15, 2024" → "2024-01-15"
  ✅ "12/31/2024" → "2024-12-31"
```
