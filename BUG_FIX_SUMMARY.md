# Bug Fix Summary: Hardcoded Path Issue

## 🐛 Bug Description
**Issue**: Script fails when hardcoded path `/workspace/` is missing
**Error**: `FileNotFoundError` when trying to write to `/workspace/scraping_results.json`
**Impact**: Script crashes if run in any directory other than `/workspace/`

## ✅ Fixes Applied

### 1. Replaced Hardcoded Paths
**Before:**
```python
with open('/workspace/scraping_results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
```

**After:**
```python
output_dir = 'scraping_output'
os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)
output_file = os.path.join(output_dir, 'scraping_results.json')
with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
```

### 2. Added Directory Creation
- Uses `os.makedirs(output_dir, exist_ok=True)` to create output directory
- `exist_ok=True` prevents errors if directory already exists
- Creates relative `scraping_output/` directory instead of hardcoded `/workspace/`

### 3. Added Error Handling
**Before:**
```python
with open('/workspace/scraping_results.json', 'w') as f:
    json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
print("Results saved to /workspace/scraping_results.json")
```

**After:**
```python
try:
    with open(output_file, 'w') as f:
        json.dump(data, f, indent=2)
    print(f"💾 Results saved to {output_file}")
except Exception as e:
    print(f"⚠️  Warning: Could not save results to file: {e}")
    print("   Results are still displayed above.")
```

### 4. Made Paths Relative
- Changed from absolute paths (`/workspace/`) to relative paths (`scraping_output/`)
- Script now works in any directory
- Uses `os.path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility

## 🧪 Testing Results

### Test 1: Run from `/tmp` directory
```bash
cd /tmp && python3 /workspace/simple_scraper.py
```
**Result**: ✅ **SUCCESS**
- Script ran without errors
- Created `scraping_output/` directory in `/tmp`
- Saved `detailed_analysis.json` successfully
- No hardcoded path dependencies

### Test 2: Directory Creation
- Script automatically creates `scraping_output/` directory
- No manual directory setup required
- Works in any working directory

### Test 3: Error Handling
- If file write fails, script continues and shows warning
- Results still displayed in console
- No crashes due to file system issues

## 📁 Files Modified

1. **`simple_scraper.py`**
   - Added `import os`
   - Replaced hardcoded `/workspace/` paths
   - Added directory creation with `os.makedirs()`
   - Added try-catch for file operations

2. **`fixed_scraper.py`**
   - Added `import os`
   - Replaced hardcoded `/workspace/` paths
   - Added directory creation with `os.makedirs()`
   - Added try-catch for file operations

## 🎯 Benefits

1. **Portability**: Script works in any directory
2. **Reliability**: No crashes due to missing directories
3. **User-Friendly**: Clear error messages if file operations fail
4. **Cross-Platform**: Uses `os.path.join()` for path handling
5. **Graceful Degradation**: Script continues even if file saving fails

## 🔧 Usage

The fixed scripts now work anywhere:

```bash
# Works in any directory
cd /home/user
python3 simple_scraper.py

# Creates scraping_output/ in current directory
# Saves results to scraping_output/detailed_analysis.json
```

**No more hardcoded path dependencies!** 🎉
