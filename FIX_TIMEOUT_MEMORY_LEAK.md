# Fix: Timeout Timer Memory Leak in Batch Processor

## Issue Description

The `setTimeout` created for the processing timeout within `processUrls` was not being cleared if the actual processing promise resolved first. This caused memory leaks and hanging timers as the setTimeout continued to run in the background unnecessarily.

## Root Cause

In the original implementation:
```javascript
// Create timeout wrapper
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject(new Error(`Processing timeout after ${this.options.timeout}ms`));
  }, this.options.timeout);
});

// Process with timeout
const result = await Promise.race([
  processor(item.url, item),
  timeoutPromise
]);
```

The timer created by `setTimeout` was never cleared when the processing completed successfully, leading to:
1. Memory leaks from accumulating timer objects
2. Unnecessary timer callbacks executing even after processing completed
3. Potential performance degradation in long-running processes

## Solution Implemented

Added proper timer cleanup using a `finally` block:

```javascript
// Create timeout wrapper with cleanup
let timeoutId;
const timeoutPromise = new Promise((_, reject) => {
  timeoutId = setTimeout(() => {
    reject(new Error(`Processing timeout after ${this.options.timeout}ms`));
  }, this.options.timeout);
});

// Process with timeout
const result = await Promise.race([
  processor(item.url, item),
  timeoutPromise
]).finally(() => {
  // Always clean up the timer
  if (timeoutId) {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
  }
});
```

## Key Changes

1. **Store timer ID**: Capture the return value of `setTimeout` in a variable
2. **Use finally block**: Ensure cleanup happens regardless of success or failure
3. **Clear the timer**: Call `clearTimeout` to remove the timer from the event loop

## Benefits

- **No memory leaks**: Timers are properly cleaned up after use
- **Better performance**: No unnecessary timer callbacks executing
- **Cleaner shutdown**: Process can exit cleanly without hanging timers

## Testing

Created comprehensive tests to verify:
1. Timers are cleaned up when processing completes successfully
2. Timers are cleaned up when processing times out
3. Multiple concurrent timeouts are handled correctly

All tests pass, confirming the fix works as expected.

## Other Observations

The HTTP client module (`enhanced-client.js`) already had proper timer cleanup in place, showing good patterns to follow. The `delay` method uses `timer.unref()` which is appropriate for its use case as it doesn't need explicit cleanup.
