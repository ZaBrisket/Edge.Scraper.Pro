## Documentation
- **[Sports Scraper Guide](docs/SPORTS_SCRAPER.md)**: Comprehensive documentation for sports features
- **[Operations Manual](docs/OPERATIONS.md)**: Deployment and configuration details
- **[Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md)**: Development standards and guidelines

## HTTP Reliability Policy
All Netlify functions delegate outbound HTTP requests to a shared client. The
client enforces timeouts, retries with jitter, per-host concurrency limits, and
adds an `x-correlation-id` for traceability. Configuration is driven by
environment variables validated via `zod`; see `.env.example` for defaults.

## Performance Metrics
- **Extraction Speed**: < 100ms per sports page
- **Content Accuracy**: ‚â• 85% for player information
- **Structured Data Quality**: ‚â• 70% completeness
- **Test Suite**: 80%+ pass rate for production readiness
