# Edge.Scraper.Pro

## Enhanced Sports Statistics Scraper
This project provides a comprehensive web scraping solution with specialized capabilities for sports statistics extraction. Built on Netlify Functions with advanced content detection, structured data parsing, and multiple export formats.

### üèà Sports-Specific Features
- **Intelligent Sports Detection**: Automatically recognizes Pro Football Reference and similar sports sites
- **Structured Data Extraction**: Player biography, statistics tables, achievements, and career data
- **Advanced Export Formats**: Enhanced CSV, structured JSON, player database, and Excel-compatible formats
- **Quality Validation**: 6-point sports content validation system with debug tools
- **Performance Optimized**: Handles 100+ player pages with detailed extraction analysis

## Usage

### Basic Web Scraping
- **UI:** Open the deployed site, paste one URL per line, and click **Scrape**
- **Programmatic:** Call `/.netlify/functions/fetch-url?url=<https URL>` to fetch HTML

### Enhanced Sports Scraping
1. Paste Pro Football Reference player URLs (one per line)
2. Enable "Debug Mode" for detailed extraction analysis
3. Use "Sports URLs Only" filter for focused results
4. Export with specialized formats:
   - **Enhanced CSV**: Sports-specific columns with player data
   - **Structured JSON**: Normalized player objects with metadata
   - **Player DB**: Relational database structure for analysis

### Example Sports URLs
```
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MahoPa00.htm
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm
https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/R/RiceJe00.htm
```

## Trivia Exporter

The trivia exporter transforms raw Pro Football Reference player data into a normalized dataset for NFL trivia applications.

### Usage

```bash
# Build the TypeScript files
npm run build

# Export trivia dataset (basic usage)
node bin/edge-scraper export

# Export with custom options
node bin/edge-scraper export \
  --input fixtures/raw/sports_structured_data.json \
  --out build/dataset.trivia_v1.json \
  --season-min 1997 --season-max 2024 \
  --positions QB,RB,WR,TE \
  --require-G-min 1 \
  --drop-summary-rows \
  --pretty \
  --verbose
```

### Options

- `--mode`: Export mode (currently only `trivia_v1`)
- `--input`: Path to input JSON file (default: `fixtures/raw/sports_structured_data.json`)
- `--out`: Output file path (default: `build/dataset.trivia_v1.json`)
- `--season-min`: Minimum season year (default: 1997)
- `--season-max`: Maximum season year (default: 2024)
- `--positions`: Comma-separated list of positions to include (default: QB,RB,WR,TE)
- `--require-G-min`: Minimum games played to include season (default: 1)
- `--drop-summary-rows`: Drop summary/aggregate rows (default: true)
- `--pretty`: Pretty-print JSON output
- `--strict`: Strict mode - fail on any error
- `--verbose`: Verbose output
- `--no-validate`: Skip schema validation

### Output Format

The exporter produces a JSON file with the following structure:

```json
{
  "schema": { "name": "trivia_v1", "version": "1.0.0" },
  "players": [
    {
      "player_id": "drew_brees",
      "full_name": "Drew Brees", 
      "pos": "QB",
      "college": "Purdue",
      "birthdate": "1979-01-15",
      "fun_fact": null
    }
  ],
  "qb_seasons": [...],
  "rb_seasons": [...],
  "wr_seasons": [...], 
  "te_seasons": [...],
  "eligibility": [...],
  "daily_picks": {},
  "generated_at": "2025-09-09T22:00:00.000Z"
}
```

### Features

- **Historical team mapping**: Correctly maps team codes across relocations (e.g., SDG ‚Üí LAC, STL ‚Üí LAR)
- **Data normalization**: Handles PFR formatting quirks, coerces numeric values, parses awards
- **Multi-team seasons**: Properly handles players who played for multiple teams in one season
- **Summary row filtering**: Removes aggregate rows like "Career", "17 Game Avg", etc.
- **Schema validation**: Built-in JSON schema validation with comprehensive error reporting
- **Position-specific stats**: Separates QB, RB, WR, and TE statistics into dedicated arrays

## HTTP Reliability Policy

### Enhanced Rate Limiting & 429 Handling
The HTTP client now provides comprehensive rate limiting and proper 429 response handling:

- **Per-Host Rate Limiting**: Token bucket implementation with configurable RPS and burst capacity
- **429-Aware Retries**: Respects `Retry-After` headers and uses exponential backoff with jitter
- **Circuit Breaker Improvements**: Only opens on genuine failures (5xx/timeouts), not rate limits
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Track rate limits, retries, circuit states, and performance

### Configuration
All HTTP behavior is controlled via environment variables:
- `HOST_LIMIT__www_pro_football_reference_com__RPS=0.5` - PFR rate limit
- `HOST_LIMIT__www_pro_football_reference_com__BURST=2` - PFR burst capacity
- `HTTP_MAX_RETRIES=3` - Maximum retry attempts
- `HTTP_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5` - Failures before circuit opens

See [Rate Limit Runbook](docs/RATE_LIMIT_RUNBOOK.md) for operational guidance.

## Performance Metrics
- **Extraction Speed**: < 100ms per sports page
- **Content Accuracy**: ‚â• 85% for player information
- **Structured Data Quality**: ‚â• 70% completeness
- **Test Suite**: 80%+ pass rate for production readiness
