# Bug Fixes Implemented

## 1. Progress Update Division by Zero and Infinite Loop

### Issue
- When processing starts, elapsed time could be 0, causing division by zero
- This resulted in NaN or Infinity being displayed for remaining time
- `requestAnimationFrame` was called unconditionally, creating an infinite loop

### Fix
```javascript
// Before
const rate = state.processedCount / elapsed;
const remaining = Math.floor((state.urls.length - state.processedCount) / rate);
requestAnimationFrame(updateProgress);

// After
if (elapsed > 0 && state.processedCount > 0) {
    const rate = state.processedCount / elapsed;
    const remaining = Math.floor((state.urls.length - state.processedCount) / rate);
    elements.remaining.textContent = formatTime(remaining);
} else {
    elements.remaining.textContent = 'calculating...';
}

// Only continue animation if still processing
if (state.isProcessing) {
    requestAnimationFrame(updateProgress);
}
```

### Benefits
- No more NaN/Infinity in UI
- Shows "calculating..." until meaningful data is available
- Animation stops when processing completes, saving CPU cycles

## 2. Hard-coded Authentication Token

### Issue
- Authentication always sent `Bearer dev-token`
- No way to configure real tokens for production
- Would fail with 401 errors in authenticated environments

### Fix
```javascript
// Before
const response = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/fetch-url?${params}`, {
    headers: {
        'Authorization': 'Bearer dev-token'
    }
});

// After
const authToken = window.AUTH_TOKEN || localStorage.getItem('edgescraperpro_token');
const headers = {};

if (authToken) {
    headers['Authorization'] = `Bearer ${authToken}`;
}

const response = await fetch(`/.netlify/functions/fetch-url?${params}`, {
    headers: headers
});
```

### Configuration Options

1. **Global Variable** (for build-time injection):
   ```javascript
   window.AUTH_TOKEN = 'your-production-token';
   ```

2. **Local Storage** (for runtime configuration):
   ```javascript
   localStorage.setItem('edgescraperpro_token', 'your-token');
   ```

3. **No Token** (for development/public endpoints):
   - Simply don't set either option
   - Request will be sent without Authorization header

### Benefits
- Flexible authentication configuration
- Works in development and production
- No hard-coded credentials in source
- Can be configured without code changes

## Testing

To test the fixes:

1. **Progress Update Fix**:
   - Start a scraping job
   - Verify "calculating..." shows initially
   - Verify proper time estimates after processing starts
   - Check DevTools that requestAnimationFrame stops after completion

2. **Authentication Fix**:
   - Without token: Should work if backend allows unauthenticated
   - With localStorage: `localStorage.setItem('edgescraperpro_token', 'test123')`
   - Check Network tab to verify Authorization header

## Deployment
These fixes have been pushed and will be included in the next Netlify deployment.
