# Hardening + Tests: HTTP Client & Batch Processor

## Summary

This PR strengthens the reliability and robustness of two critical high-risk modules: the Enhanced HTTP Client and the Batch Processor. These modules handle external I/O, manage concurrency, and process large volumes of data, making them essential for system stability.

## Changes Made

### Enhanced HTTP Client (`src/lib/http/enhanced-client.js`)

**Hardening Improvements:**
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Added Zod schemas to validate URLs and options with clear error messages
- ✅ **Guard Clauses**: Validate all inputs at module boundaries (URL format, options, timeouts)
- ✅ **Timeout Management**: Enforced timeouts on all network calls with proper cleanup
- ✅ **Retry Logic**: Bounded retries with exponential backoff and jitter for better distribution
- ✅ **Error Categorization**: Structured errors with stable codes (NETWORK_ERROR, TIMEOUT, RATE_LIMIT, etc.)
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of timers, limiters, and active requests on shutdown
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: SIGINT/SIGTERM handlers with active request tracking
- ✅ **Memory Management**: TTL-based cleanup of limiters and circuits to prevent memory leaks
- ✅ **Thread Safety**: Careful state management with no shared mutable state issues

**Key Features:**
- Circuit breaker pattern with half-open state for gradual recovery
- Per-host rate limiting with configurable RPS and burst
- Metrics tracking for monitoring and debugging
- Correlation ID propagation for request tracing
- Intelligent retry handling (429s don't count toward circuit breaker)

### Batch Processor (`src/lib/batch-processor.js`)

**Hardening Improvements:**
- ✅ **Input Validation**: Comprehensive URL validation with private host detection
- ✅ **Idempotency**: URL normalization and deduplication before processing
- ✅ **Concurrency Control**: Bounded worker pool with configurable limits
- ✅ **Memory Efficiency**: Chunked validation, bounded error storage, pattern limiting
- ✅ **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress reporting with phase tracking
- ✅ **Error Intelligence**: Categorized errors with pattern detection and recommendations
- ✅ **Graceful Shutdown**: Pause/resume/stop controls with proper state management
- ✅ **Resource Cleanup**: Active batch tracking and cleanup on process exit

**Key Features:**
- Smart error recommendations based on patterns
- Order preservation throughout the pipeline
- Detailed metrics and throughput calculation
- Memory-aware processing with periodic cleanup
- Export format optimized for debugging

## Testing

### Enhanced HTTP Client Tests
- Input validation (URLs, options, configuration)
- Rate limiting and retry behavior
- Circuit breaker states (closed, open, half-open)
- Timeout handling and cancellation
- Error propagation and categorization
- Resource cleanup and memory management
- Metrics accuracy

### Batch Processor Tests
- URL validation and normalization
- Deduplication logic
- Concurrency limits enforcement
- Error categorization and reporting
- Progress tracking accuracy
- Pause/resume/stop functionality
- Memory limits and cleanup
- Order preservation

## Before/After Behavior

### Enhanced HTTP Client
**Before:**
- No input validation
- Unbounded retries
- Memory leaks from uncleaned limiters
- No graceful shutdown
- Limited error context

**After:**
- Strict input validation with clear errors
- Bounded retries with jitter
- TTL-based resource cleanup
- Graceful shutdown with request tracking
- Detailed error categorization

### Batch Processor
**Before:**
- Basic URL validation
- No memory bounds on error storage
- Limited error insights
- No pause/resume capability
- Basic progress reporting

**After:**
- Comprehensive URL validation with security checks
- Memory-efficient error storage with limits
- Intelligent error patterns and recommendations
- Full pause/resume/stop controls
- Detailed progress tracking by phase

## Configuration

All settings are configurable via environment variables:

```bash
# HTTP Client
HTTP_MAX_RETRIES=3
HTTP_BASE_BACKOFF_MS=1000
HTTP_MAX_BACKOFF_MS=30000
HTTP_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD=5
HTTP_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_RESET_MS=30000

# Batch Processor
HTTP_MAX_CONCURRENCY=5
HTTP_DEADLINE_MS=30000
```

## Test Coverage

- Enhanced HTTP Client: 13 core tests covering all major functionality
- Batch Processor: 13 core tests covering validation, processing, and edge cases
- All tests are deterministic (no sleeps, controlled timing)

## Known Issues

None. All tests pass successfully.

## Follow-up Work

- Harden sports extractor module
- Harden config module  
- Set up CI with coverage and flakiness detection
- Create reliability playbook documentation

## Breaking Changes

None. All changes maintain backward compatibility with enhanced error handling.
